We may not like doctors, but at least they doctor.  Bankers are not ever
popular but at least they bank.  Policeman police and undertakers take
under.  But lawyers do not give us law.  We receive not the gladsome light
of jurisprudence, but rather precedents, objections, appeals, stays,
filings and forms, motions and counter-motions, all at $250 an hour.

"Certainly, if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after
 walking out of Neiman-Marcus they would expect to be eventually told
 what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell
 the accused that 'you know what you stole I'm not telling.' Or, to
 simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman-Marcus' entire
 inventory and say 'it's in there somewhere, you figure it out.'"

"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is
 that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox
 in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or
 force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there
 are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur
 to us."

"The right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the
 Constitution against State action includes both the right to speak
 freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all, except in so far
 as essential operations of government may require it for the
 preservation of an orderly society,---as in the case of compulsion to
 give evidence in court."
    -- Justice Murphy, in concurrance, West Virginia State Board of
       Education v. Barnette 319 U.S. 624 No. 591

Here's the thing about lawyers: they don't write to communicate. Lawyers
are like programmers, their code doesn't have to be human-readable. It may
even be deliberately obfuscated. It just has to run on the target system and
produce the desired outcome. In the case of terms-of-use language, the target
system is the courts, and the desired outcome is income.
