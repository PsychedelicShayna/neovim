-- TidalCycles, in short, is a tool to create music programmatically. It's not
-- technically a programming language, rather it's a library for Haskell that
-- leverages Haskell's abstraction and flexibility to define a whole plethora 
-- of unqiue syntax that allows for the expression of abstract algorithms, and
-- the manipulation of patterns as well as time, in order to create music!

-- This plugin integrates TidalCycles' live coding environment into Neovim. 
-- Though it's not strictly necessary. TidalCycles can technically be used
-- anywhere on any editor by just binding certain commands to control the
-- playback and parse specific expressions to change the realtime playback.
